# Ultrablinky Hardware

Ultrablinky is a strobelight/stroboscope that has multiple blink modes and can be triggered by different stimuli. If blinking an LED is the "Hello, world!" of the hardware/firmware world, Ultrablinky is the equivalent of shouting "HELLO, WORLD!"

## Use cases:
- Camera strobe, where a set number of flashes are triggered by motion
- Continuous flashing, because you know you want to pretend like you're at a rave
- Flashing synchronized with sound, because you still want to pretend you're at a rave, but you got tired of the asynchronous flashing
- Continuous flashing to freeze repetitive motion. Although it will look like the motion is stopped, don't be an idiot and stick your fingers in it, because it will hurt.
- Do other cool stuff that hasn't been thought of yet.

## Hardware
The "blinky" in the Ultrablinky is a 100W COB LED. This LED has forward voltage Vf of
30V-36V with a current of 3.5A.
